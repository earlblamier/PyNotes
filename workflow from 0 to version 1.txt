Here's an example workflow from the initial development stages up to the release of version 1.0.0, with different stages of adding new features, following Python's filename conventions and development stages:

Workflow from Initial Development to Version 1.0.0 Release:
Starting Development (Initial Setup):

initial_setup.py
Early Development (Adding Core Functionality):

core_functionality_v0.1.py
core_functionality_v0.2.py
core_functionality_v0.3.py
Feature Additions and Improvements:

feature_addition_v0.4.py
feature_addition_v0.5.py
feature_addition_v0.6.py
Refactoring and Optimization:

refactoring_v0.7.py
refactoring_v0.8.py
refactoring_v0.9.py
Testing and Bug Fixes:

testing_and_fixes_v0.10.py
testing_and_fixes_v0.11.py
testing_and_fixes_v0.12.py
Pre-Release Preparation (Version 1.0.0):

pre_release_v1.0.0.py
These filenames represent a hypothetical workflow where the project starts with initial setup, progresses through various stages of feature additions, refactoring, testing, and bug fixes, leading up to the pre-release stage for version 1.0.0.

Each filename iteration (v0.1, v0.2, etc.) indicates the addition of new features or changes while maintaining the version progression before the major release (v1.0.0).

This scenario demonstrates a progressive development cycle with several stages of adding new features, improvements, and preparation for the version 1.0.0 release, all while following Python's filename conventions and versioning.
